This file serves as a context for the Gemini CLI agent.
The 'oracle' repository is a personal, version-controlled knowledge base used by the user to store research, plans, notes, and troubleshooting steps.
The agent should refer to this repository for historical context and information relevant to the user's ongoing tasks and learning.

## Rules
- The repository is shared with other LLM CLIs (e.g., Codex, Claude).
- Always confirm with the user before making changes to file content.
- Do not touch files meant for other agents, specifically `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`.
