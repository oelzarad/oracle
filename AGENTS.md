# AI Context for Oracle Repo

Purpose: This repository is a personal knowledge base and timeline. Entries can include research notes, troubleshooting logs, learning sessions, and follow-ups. Each entry should be understandable later and benefit from Git history.

How to help:
- Prefer creating or updating Markdown files under clear, descriptive paths.
- Keep notes structured with headings, dates, and summaries.
- Capture conclusions and next steps; if relevant, add references or sources.
- Preserve the user's tone; keep content concise and skimmable.

Conventions:
- Use ASCII unless the entry already uses Unicode or needs it (e.g., names).
- Avoid overwriting existing notes without confirming.

If unsure about structure, ask for a filename or suggested template.
