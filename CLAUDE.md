# Oracle

A personal knowledge base and digital memory system, version-controlled with git.

## Purpose

This repo stores information I want to remember and reference later. Git versioning provides a timeline of when things were captured and how they evolved.

## Content Types

- **Research & Plans** - Trip planning, purchase decisions, project research with conclusions and outcomes
- **Technical Notes** - Troubleshooting steps, resolutions, configurations
- **Learning Sessions** - Notes from learning new skills, concepts, or tools
- **Anything worth remembering** - Context around decisions, not just outcomes

## Structure

Content is stored as markdown files (and other relevant formats) organized by topic or project.

## Important Rules

- **Confirm before modifying** - Always confirm with the user before creating, editing, or deleting any content in this repo
- **Do not touch other agent files** - `AGENTS.md` and `GEMINI.md` belong to other LLM CLIs that share this folder; leave them alone

## Usage

This folder is shared by multiple LLM CLIs (Claude, Codex, Gemini). When helping here, I'm assisting with capturing, organizing, and retrieving knowledge. The goal is to help the user pick up where they left off and maintain continuity across time.
