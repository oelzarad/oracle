# Oracle

A personal knowledge base and digital memory system, version-controlled with git.

## Purpose

This repo stores information I want to remember and reference later. Git versioning provides a timeline of when things were captured and how they evolved.

## Content Types

- **Research & Plans** - Trip planning, purchase decisions, project research with conclusions and outcomes
- **Technical Notes** - Troubleshooting steps, resolutions, configurations
- **Learning Sessions** - Notes from learning new skills, concepts, or tools
- **Anything worth remembering** - Context around decisions, not just outcomes

## Structure

Content is stored as markdown files (and other relevant formats) organized by topic or project.

## Usage

When helping here, I'm assisting with capturing, organizing, and retrieving knowledge. The goal is to help the user pick up where they left off and maintain continuity across time.
